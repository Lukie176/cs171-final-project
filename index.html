    <div class="text section">
        <p>Just as any other NFL Football season, avid football fans across the nation have continued to cheer their favorite teams into the endzone. Despite the incredible plays, Fantasy Football managers have no doubt noticed several high profile players, such as Dak Prescott, Christian McCaffrey, and Nick Chubb become sidelined due to injury. While many would be quick to blame these injuries on this year’s unorthodox conditions, let's take a look at how this year's injuries, from Week 1 to Week 9, compare to past year's.

        <p> One might be quick to assume that injuries in this season would be noticeably higher due to a lack of preseason training and preparation. However, the data indicates that this season's total injuries are consistent with previous years. While the prevalence of injuries hasn't risen, football is still one of the most injury prone sports. As players are carted off the field and fans are left heartbroken (whether that is out of concern for the player or knowing that he won’t be making you fantasy points anytime soon), it’s important that we broaden our understanding as fans of this sport, especially when it comes to the well-being of players we have come to know, love, and cheer for.

        <p> Whether you’re born to a dynasty of Vikings fans or are just breaking into your love for the Steelers, different teams also carry different risks of injury. Differences can be partially explained by different playbooks that teams live by, but by looking at injuries by team, we can at least see where the most risk lies.
