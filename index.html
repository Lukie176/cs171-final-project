            <p> Just as any other NFL Football season, avid football fans across the nation have continued to cheer their
                favorite teams into the endzone. Despite the incredible plays, viewers have no doubt noticed several high
                profile players, such as Dak Prescott, Christian McCaffrey, and Nick Chubb, become sidelined due to
                injury. Many would be quick to blame these injuries on this year’s unorthodox conditions, so let's take
                a look at how this year's injuries, from Week 1 to Week 9, compare to past years.

            <p> NFL viewers might have been quick to assume that injuries in this season would be noticeably higher due to a lack of
                preseason training and preparation. However, as seen above, this season's total injuries are
                consistent with previous years. While the prevalence of injuries hasn't risen, football is still one of
                the most injury prone sports. As players are carted off the field and fans are left heartbroken (whether
                out of concern for the player or knowing that he won’t be making you fantasy points anytime
                soon), it’s important that we broaden our understanding as fans of this sport, especially when it comes
                to the well-being of players we have come to know, love, and cheer for.

                    <p> One of the most pertinent factors to understand is that risk of injury is centralized to certain body parts.
                        At first glance, we can see that NFL players injure almost every part of the body. However,
                        lower-body injuries, particularly to the knee, ankle, and thigh, are especially prevalent in the NFL.
                        In this visualization, you can see a breakdown of how many times each injury appeared on past injury reports. Feel free

            <p> Whether you’re born to a dynasty of Vikings fans or are just breaking into your love for the Steelers,
                a player's team is also a determinant of injury risk. Differences can be partially explained by different
                playbooks that teams live by, but by looking at injuries by team, we can at least see where the most risk

                    their weekly injury reports.

            <p> With a broader understanding of the risk that these players take on, as well as the many determinants
